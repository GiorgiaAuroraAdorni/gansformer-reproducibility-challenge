%	\section*{General notes}
%	
%	The report should be written as an article intended to present the findings of your work. Your aim 
%	should be to be clear and objective, substantiating your claims with references or 
%	empirical/theoretical evidence.
%	
%	We are well aware of the fact that carrying out machine learning experiments might be difficult and 
%	that often the final performance might be disappointing. For this reason, you will not be evaluated 
%	solely on quantitative aspect of your work, but mainly on the quality of your analysis and report.
%	
%	The length of the report should be between 4 and 8 pages (without considering references).
	
	\section{Introduction}
	This project consists in a reproducibility challenge whose objective is to investigate the 
	reliability and reproducibility of a paper accepted for publication in a top machine learning 
	conference.
	The models have been implemented using code and information provided by the authors.	
	Actually we are not participating formally to the Fall Edition of the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2021.
	
	We selected the paper ``\emph{Generative adversarial transformers}'' by 
	\citet{hudson2021generative} and verified the empirical results and claims in it by reproducing three 
	of the computational experiments performed by the authors:
	\begin{enumerate*}
		\item[(1)] the \textbf{StyleGAN2} by \citet{karras2020analyzing}, a GAN network which uses one 
		global latent style vector to modulate the features of each layer, hence to control the style of all 
		image features globally,
		\item[(2)] the \textbf{GANformer} with \textbf{Simplex Attention} by 
		\citet{hudson2021generative}, a generalisation of the StyleGAN design with \textit{k} latent 
		vectors that cooperate through attention, allowing for a spatially finer control over the generation 
		process since multiple style vectors impact different regions in the image concurrently, in 
		particular permitting communication in one direction, in the generative context – from the latents 
		to the image features, and
		\item[(3)] the \textbf{GANformer} with \textbf{Duplex Attention} by \citet{hudson2021generative}, 
		which is based on the same principles as the previous but propagating information both from 
		global latents to local image features, enabling both top-down and bottom-up reasoning to occur 
		simultaneously.
	\end{enumerate*} 
	
	The first model is used as baseline, while the remaining are the architectures introduced by the 
	authors. Thy consider the GANformer has ``a novel and efficient type of transformer'' which 
	demonstrates its strength and robustness over a range of task of visual generative modelling —  
	simulated multi-object environments (real-world indoor and out-door scenes) — achieving 
	state-of-the-art results in terms of both image quality and diversity, while benefiting from fast 
	learning and better data-efficiency.

	\section{Methodology (change the name of this section as you see fit)}
	
%	In this section you should give a description of the methodological aspects of your work, for 
%	instance how you modified an existing method to perform a particular task or to overcome a 
%	particular limitation. If your project is about reproducibility, here you should describe the method 
%	presented in the original paper.

	\section{Implementation}
%	
%	This section should be structured as follows (from the Reproducibility challenge template):
%	
%	---
%	
%	Briefly describe what you did and which resources did you use. E.g. Did you use author's code, did 
%	you re-implement parts of the pipeline, how much time did it take to produce the results, what 
%	hardware you were using and how long it took to train/evaluate. 
%	
	The code has been implemented using code and information provided by the authors.
	
	\subsection{Datasets}
	%Describe the datasets you used and how you obtained them. 
	
	The original paper \cite{hudson2021generative} explored the GANformer model on four datasets for 
	images and scenes: CLEVR \cite{johnson2017clevr}, LSUN-Bedrooms \cite{yu2015lsun}, Cityscapes 
	\cite{cordts2016cityscapes} and FFHQ \cite{karras2019style}. 
	
	Initially, we tried to use the Cityscapes dataset, since it is the smaller among the four: with a size of 
	8GB, it contains 24998 images with 256x256 resolution. 
	However, the time to complete the training was to high on this dataset (TODO: how much?), even if 
	using computational resources like GPU.
	
	For this reason, we switch to another dataset, the Google Cartoon Set \cite{cartoonset}\footnote{	
		\url{https://google.github.io/cartoonset}}, containing 10k/100k 2D cartoon avatar 
	images composed of 16 components that vary in 10 artwork attributes, 4 colour attributes, and 4 
	proportion attributes (see in Table \ref{tab:dataset}). 
	%TODO what about resolution and size??

	\subsection{Hyperparameters}
%	Describe how you set the hyperparameters and what was the source for their value (e.g. paper, 
%code 
%	or your guess). 
	
	\subsection{Experimental setup}
	%	Explain how you ran your experiments, e.g. the CPU/GPU resources and provide the link to your 
	%	code and notebooks. 
	
	The source code of our work is available at the following GitHub repository: 
	\url{https://github.com/GiorgiaAuroraAdorni/gansformer-reproducibility-challenge}.
	 
	 The approaches proposed in both the original paper codebase by \citet{karras2020analyzing} and 
	 by \citet{hudson2021generative} have been implemented in Python using TensorFlow 
	 \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}, so, according to that, we used the same setup.
	 We created a Jupyter Notebook which runs all the experiments in Google Colaboratory, which 
	 allows us to write and execute Python in the browser.
	
	 All the models have been trained on a Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB (GPU) provided by Google 
	 Colab Pro.
	
	\subsection{Computational requirements}
	%	Provide information on computational requirements for each of your experiments. For example, 
	%   the  number of CPU/GPU hours and memory requirements. You'll need to think about this ahead 
	%	of time, and write your code in a way that captures this information so you can later add it to 
	%	this section.
