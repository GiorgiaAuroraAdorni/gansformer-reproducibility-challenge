\begin{document}
	
	\maketitle
	
	\begin{abstract}
		Concise and self-contained description of your project, motivation and main findings.
	\end{abstract}
	
%	\section*{General notes}
%	
%	The report should be written as an article intended to present the findings of your work. Your aim 
%	should be to be clear and objective, substantiating your claims with references or 
%	empirical/theoretical evidence.
%	
%	We are well aware of the fact that carrying out machine learning experiments might be difficult and 
%	that often the final performance might be disappointing. For this reason, you will not be evaluated 
%	solely on quantitative aspect of your work, but mainly on the quality of your analysis and report.
%	
%	The length of the report should be between 4 and 8 pages (without considering references).
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
%	Here you should clarify the context of your project and the problem you are dealing with. You 
%	should also make a brief summary of the main results and contributions (i.e., if you tried to 
%replicate 
%	the results of an existing paper you should say if you were successful or not). The introduction 
%	should help the reader to follow along for the rest of the paper.
%	
	
	
	\section{Related works}
	
%	Give a brief summary of (some) existing methods that are related to you project. For instance, if 
%you 
%	project is about fine tuning a language model for a specific task, here you should give some 
%	examples of successful applications of this approach~\cite{hudson2021generative}. In this section 
%it 
%	is important to provide readers references to the current state of the art and the foundations of 
%the 
%	presented method. 
%	
%	N.B.: When referencing a different approach, it is not necessary to provide a detailed description, 
%	only one/two brief sentences are enough. The interested readers can eventually read the 
%referenced 
%	work. 
	
	\section{Methodology (change the name of this section as you see fit)}
	
%	In this section you should give a description of the methodological aspects of your work, for 
%	instance how you modified an existing method to perform a particular task or to overcome a 
%	particular limitation. If your project is about reproducibility, here you should describe the method 
%	presented in the original paper.
	
	\section{Implementation}
%	
%	This section should be structured as follows (from the Reproducibility challenge template):
%	
%	---
%	
%	Briefly describe what you did and which resources did you use. E.g. Did you use author's code, did 
%	you re-implement parts of the pipeline, how much time did it take to produce the results, what 
%	hardware you were using and how long it took to train/evaluate. 
%	
	\subsection{Datasets}
	%Describe the datasets you used and how you obtained them. 
	
	The original paper \cite{hudson2021generative} explored the GANformer model on four datasets for 
	images and scenes: CLEVR \cite{johnson2017clevr}, LSUN-Bedrooms \cite{yu2015lsun}, Cityscapes 
	\cite{cordts2016cityscapes} and FFHQ \cite{karras2019style}. 
	
	Initially, we tried to use the Cityscapes dataset, since it is the smaller among the four: with a size of 
	8GB, it contains 24998 images with 256x256 resolution. 
	However, the time to complete the training was to high on this dataset (TODO: how much?), even if 
	using computational resources like GPU.
	
	For this reason, we switch to another dataset, the Google Cartoon Set\footnote{	
	\url{https://google.github.io/cartoonset}} \cite{cartoonset}, containing 10k/100k 2D cartoon avatar 
	images composed of 16 components that vary in 10 artwork attributes, 4 colour attributes, and 4 
	proportion attributes (see in Table \ref{tab:dataset}). 
	%TODO what about resolution and size??

	\subsection{Hyperparameters}
%	Describe how you set the hyperparameters and what was the source for their value (e.g. paper, 
%code 
%	or your guess). 
	
	\subsection{Experimental setup}
	%	Explain how you ran your experiments, e.g. the CPU/GPU resources and provide the link to your 
	%	code and notebooks. 
	
	The source code of our work is available her: 
	\url{https://github.com/GiorgiaAuroraAdorni/gansformer-reproducibility-challenge}.
	 
	 The proposed approach has been implemented in Python. We created a Jupyter Notebook \cite{...}  
	 which runs all the experiments in a Google Colaboratory \cite{...}.
	 All the models have been trained on a Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB (GPU) provided by Google 
	 Colab Pro \cite{...}.
	
	The model have been implemented in TensorFlow \cite{...} as in the original paper codebase 
	introduced by the StyleGAN \cite{...} and GANformer \cite{...} authors.
	
	\subsection{Computational requirements}
	%	Provide information on computational requirements for each of your experiments. For example, 
	%   the  number of CPU/GPU hours and memory requirements. You'll need to think about this ahead 
	%	of time, and write your code in a way that captures this information so you can later add it to 
	%	this section. 
	
	stylegan2 2 hours and 30 minutes for the training 
	

	\section{Results}
	
%	In this section you should report the results of your work (e.g., the outcome of an empirical 
%	analysis). You should be objective and support your statements with empirical evidence.
%	
%	Use figures, plots and tables to present your results in a nice and readable way.
%	
%	Refer to the Reproducibility Challenge template for hints on how to structure this in case you are 
%	trying to replicate someone else's results.
	
	\section{Discussion and conclusion}
	
%	Here you can express your judgments and draw your conclusions based on the  evidences 
%produced 
%	on the previous sections.
%	
%	Try to summarize the achievements of your project and its limits, suggesting (when appropriate) 
%	possible extensions and future works.
